Each of the above-described time intervals... (text continues) Document Revision:

Part 5 of 16:

The time intervals 1 through 52 shall each incorporate and include a remainder over, in absolute fee simple. These will exist as a tenant in common with others, holding a 1/52nd interest in the condominium unit in which it is created upon the termination of this Declaration.

Exclusive Right to Occupancy: Each time interval will include the exclusive right to occupy the condominium unit and enjoy the interests and privileges associated with it. This right is vested in the owner of the time interval, excluding other owners for that period. This right is subject to the covenants, conditions, and restrictions set forth in this Declaration and the Condominium Declaration.

Status of Time Intervals: Each time interval represents a separate estate in real property with all the incidents of real property. Every time interval is wholly separate and distinct from all other time intervals in the condominium unit. It should not be considered a tenancy in common, a concurrent individual or undivided interest, or any other type of co-tenancy. However, any time interval can be owned by more than one person as joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by entirety, or in any other real property tenancy relationship recognized under Maryland State law. Any time interval can be separately and individually conveyed, leased, mortgaged, encumbered, inherited, and devised by Will or intestate distribution.

Presumption Against Merger - Intention of Declarant: The acquisition of a time interval by any person will not merge the estate for years with the remainder interest in the condominium unit. Each shall continue as separate and distinct estates until the Declaration terminates.

Description of Time Intervals: A description in any deed or other instrument affecting the title to any time interval which:

(a) References the identifying number or letter assigned to the Time Interval.

(b) Incorporates the provisions of this Declaration by reference to the place where it is recorded among the Land Records for Worcester County, Maryland.

(c) Describes the condominium unit by reference to the letter or number or other appropriate designation on the Condominium Plat, along with a reference to the Condominium Plat.

This shall be a good and sufficient description of the Time Interval for all purposes.

Covenant Against Further Subdivision: No owner of a time interval shall grant, sell, convey, hypothecate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber less than all of the time interval. Any such action shall be void. However, this does not prohibit the leasing of less than all of the time interval.

Covenant Against Encumbrances: No owner of a time interval shall attempt to grant, convey, hypothecate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber any interest in the condominium unit other than his time interval. Any such action shall be void.

Covenant Against Partition: No owner of a time interval or any other person shall bring any action for partition of the condominium unit or for sale of the condominium unit in lieu of partition. However, this does not prohibit an action for partition of a time interval.

3. Condition of Condominium Unit: Each owner of a time interval shall maintain the condominium unit in good condition and repair, and in a clean and sanitary state, during his time interval.

Article IV:

I. The Manager: The owners of the time intervals shall employ a management agent, a management firm, or a manager (the "Manager") at a rate of compensation established by the owners and the Manager.

In the event of any proceeding for the collection of any assessment or charge levied pursuant to this Declaration with respect to any time interval in the condominium unit, the owner of such time interval may be immediately required to pay a reasonable rental for the continued use and enjoyment of the time interval. The party or parties initiating such proceeding shall be immediately entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the same.

Estoppel Certificates: The manager shall, upon demand, furnish to the owner of any time interval liable for any assessment levied pursuant to this Declaration, and to any other party legitimately interested in the same, a written certificate executed by an officer or agent of the Manager. This certificate will set forth the status of said assessment i.e., whether any past installments thereof remain unpaid as of a certain date. Any such certificate shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes that all assessments levied pursuant to this Declaration, and all installments thereof, which became due prior to the date of such certificate have been paid in full. The Manager shall be entitled to charge and collect, in advance, a reasonable fee for each certificate delivered, provided, however, that no charge shall be made by the Manager to any institutional mortgagee of any time interval in the condominium unit who requests such a certificate in writing.

Any holder of any deed of trust, mortgage or other encumbrance duly recorded on any time interval in the condominium unit and made in good faith for value received who comes into possession of the time interval pursuant to a foreclosure or any deed, assignment or other proceeding or arrangement in lieu of foreclosure and any other purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall take the time interval free of any claims for unpaid assessments levied against the time interval which accrue prior to the time such holder comes into possession of the time interval or prior to the ratification of the foreclosure sale, the delivery of the deed or assignment or the conclusion of such other proceeding or arrangement in lieu of foreclosure, except for claims for a proportionate share of such unpaid assessments resulting from a reallocation of such unpaid assessments among all the owners of the other time intervals in the condominium unit.

However, such default shall not affect the priorities established by this Article, or otherwise, the validity of any assessment or charge levied or made pursuant to this Declaration or the validity or enforceability of any lien to secure the same.

Roster of Mortgagees: Any owner of a time interval in the condominium unit who mortgages his time interval shall give prompt written notice to the Manager of the name and address of his mortgagee and shall file a conformed copy of the mortgage with the Manager. The Manager shall maintain such information in a suitable roster.

Termination by Owners: Subject to the limitations set forth in this Declaration, the owners of all the time intervals in the condominium unit may terminate this Declaration by an instrument in writing executed and acknowledged by each of them. Any such termination will become effective only upon the recordation of such instrument among the Land Records of Worcester County, Maryland, or at a later specified date in the instrument.

Termination: Unless sooner terminated by the owners of all the time intervals in the condominium unit, this Declaration will terminate, without further action, at midnight on the 31st day of December, 2040, or upon the termination of the Condominium, whichever occurs first.

Effect of Termination: Upon termination for any reason, the condominium unit will be owned by the owners of the time intervals as tenants in common, each of whom will then own a 1/52nd interest, in fee simple, absolute, in the condominium unit as a tenant in common with the other owners.

In such event, the net proceeds of sale will be considered as one fund and will be divided among the owners of the time intervals, each entitled to a 1/52nd share of such fund, after first discharging any and all liens upon the interest of each owner in accordance with the priority of interest in such interest.

There is hereby created and declared to be a presumption that any violation or breach, or any attempted violation or breach, of any of the terms or provisions of this Declaration cannot be adequately remedied by an action at law or exclusively by the recovery of damages.
